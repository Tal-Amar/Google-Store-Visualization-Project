## Overview
This project focuses on visualizing data from the Google Store dataset obtained from Kaggle. The goal is to analyze and present insights about the applications available on the Google Store.

## Folder Structure
### /.streamlit
This folder contains a 'config' file that sets up a default theme for running the application on any user's computer.

### /data
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geothomas/playstore-dataset). The dataset has been processed and divided into four sub-datasets, each catering to a specific chart or analysis. Additionally, the folder includes:

*A stopwords text file used for text analysis in the word bubble chart.
*A currency JSON file for converting application prices into USD terms.

### /design
This folder contains the Google Store icon, which is displayed in the HTML head section of the application.

### /preprocessing_code
This folder contains the code for data preprocessing, including cleaning and preparing the dataset. It also includes code for creating sub-datasets that are used for generating the charts and visualizations.
